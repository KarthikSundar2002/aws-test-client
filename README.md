# aws-test-client

<p>A test AWS S3 client written using python, boto3 and AWS SDK.</p>
<p>Before you run the program make sure you change the access key id and secret access key in the client and resource. </p>
<p>After changing those, you can run the program. As of now, we can create buckets and we can access the existing buckets. Basically as of now, when we access a bucket, it searches test.txt. Using this file, it generates a presigned URL, which allows us to see the contents of text.txt</p>
